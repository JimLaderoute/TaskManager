Things Not Yet Done but should get done

1/17/2017

o Create github account for Danny so we can share code. (1 hour) [done]
o Show Dan how to use github [done - emailed instructions]
o Watch more jQuery training video (1 hour) [done]

1/21/2017

o Figure out how to update the elapsed time [done]
  timerVar = setTimeout(timeoutCallback, timePeriod);

1/26/2017

o Change row background color immediately when we change toggle state of the timer [done]
o Add unique id column so we can easily track each task by id number [done]
o Store high-precision elapsed time as a JQuery Data item to prevent roundoff errors [done]
o Share time-chunk across all enabled tasks [done]

o Dan tuned the look and feel of the web-app so it looks better
o Removed highlight of the row when you start the timer - this will mess up the nice zebra-coloring and it's really not needed.
o Updating elapsed time every 1 second now instead of every 5 seconds (not a resource issue at all)
o Made Title and Category editable in-place via contenteditable='true' setting
  <td id=Title contenteditable='true'> textual content </td>
o Double-clicking on Elapsed data clears the timer back to 0 seconds - but really want to edit the time for the day.

1/30/2017

o Added a Percentage column ; to see what percent of your time you spent today

1/31/2017

o We enable the [Delete] button only if an item or two is having it's elapsed time updated. If nothing
  is selected then no need to have the Delete button enabled.
o Today I submitted a question to Stackoverflow.com to find out how to get at each <td> value of 
  each row in a foreach loop given the <tr> object.

2/1/2017

o Cleaned up the CSS statements by removing things that were not required and accepting the Browser defaults.
o Saving changes out to a JSON file under WAMP server

2/5/2017

o Setup Beagle-bone as a web server and able to run TaskManager from it now.
o Debugged some asynchronous issue and a couple other coding bugs

3/20/2017

o Converted the code from using json text files to using a MySql database

3/24/2017

o Added [HIDE] column to hide tasks but not delete them
o Added Options to Show [Visible|Hidden|Both], so you can show hidden tasks and flip them back to visible if you wish
o Added [+] and [-] buttons; to add or subtract 1 hour's worth of time for the selected tasks



FUTURE TO DOS

o Modify Existing Tasks (add/subtract hours or minutes from elapsed time, view previous days work)
o I'm currently using <table> object for the info. I believe there is a nicer TABLE .js package out there that I could use. Probably would allow sorting of columns and resizing of columns. https://datatables.net/
o Allow more than one person at a time to use this ( username based )
    + Add Login and Register screens
o Learn how to run regression tests on this - Node.js ; nodeunit ; Mocha ; Vows ; Zombie ...
o Learn about AngularJS and incorporate learnings into this application (if useful)
o Get it working fully on BeagleBone with MySql
o Dan to design the look and feel
o Allow ADMIN to view tasks of all users
