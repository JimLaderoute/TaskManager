USING: TP-LINK 150Mbps Wireless N Nano USB Adapter 
Model No: TL-WN725N


You can setup wireless network stuff using command "wicd-curses"
See: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-CIGQYdk8ZhU3D3UCNn70jc7C9HdXvEZAsiNW71fGIE/edit#

To connect to a WPA protected wireless network, first encrypt the WPA passphrase:
# wpa_passphrase [SSID] [passphrase]
> wpa_passphrase HOMELAN [passphrase]
network={
        ssid="HOMELAN"
        #psk="passphrase"
        psk=6249ea03b21eb70296c05089052b4930733b7aac174c6330631f346406fbb51d
}


Use nano to edit Connman config file:
NOTE: connman is used with Angstrom distribution on Beaglebone, my device uses debian
# nano /var/lib/connman/wifi.config

and enter:
[service_home]
Type = wifi
Name = YourSSID
Passphrase = YourEncryptedPassphrase

NOTE: do not put your SSID in quotes, even if it contains spaces


# shutdown -r now
# ifconfig ra0


NOTE: the file that contains the usb0 ip-address information is in /etc/network/interfaces

# nano /etc/network/interfaces

auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
   wpa-ssid HOMELAN
   wpa-psk danflowers123

ifup wlan0
ifconfig wlan0
ping router-ip-here
ping google.com


The following URL mentions somthing extra in the /etc/network/interfaces file that should be added
    https://raspberrypi4dummies.wordpress.com/tag/wpa_supplicant-sbinwpa_supplicant-daemon-failed-to-start/

auto wlan0
allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
   wpa-ssid HOMELAN
   wpa-psk danflowers123

ctrl-x and Y to save changes
Now just restart your network connections

sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
or reboot with sudo reboot

=============================
On another website: forums.debian.net they said for wpa-psk to use the encrypted
string and not the plain text string. So, I tried that.

=============================
And on another site, they didn't use the encrypted value, they used the plain-text
value. Arghhh...  Switching back to plain-text password and also putting double
quotes around it as shown in some other examples.

# nano /etc/network/interfaces

auto wlan0
allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
   wpa-ssid HOMELAN
   wpa-psk danflowers123

#sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart

NOTE: I'm starting to think that my BBB just does not support my USB Wifi device.
